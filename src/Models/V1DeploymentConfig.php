/**
 * Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or configuration
 * changes. A single deployment configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can
 * support many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates,
 * and  fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks. Each individual deployment
 * is represented as a replication controller.
 *
 * A deployment is "triggered" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an Image Stream is changed.
 * Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control over a deployment. The "strategy" determines how
 * the deployment is carried out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated
 * when a new deployment is triggered by any means.
