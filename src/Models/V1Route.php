/**
 * A route allows developers to expose services through an HTTP(S) aware load balancing and proxy layer
 * via a public DNS entry. The route may further specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a
 * public CNAME that the router should also accept for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. An administrator
 * typically configures their router to be visible outside the cluster firewall, and may also add
 * additional security, caching, or traffic controls on the service content. Routers usually talk
 * directly to the service endpoints.
 *
 * Once a route is created, the `host` field may not be changed. Generally, routers use the oldest
 * route with a given host when resolving conflicts.
 *
 * Routers are subject to additional customization and may support additional controls via the
 * annotations field.
 *
 * Because administrators may configure multiple routers, the route status field is used to return
 * information to clients about the names and states of the route under each router. If a client
 * chooses a duplicate name, for instance, the route status conditions are used to indicate the route
 * cannot be chosen.
